        <p>
          I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a background in Chemical Engineering.
          I have always been interested in technology, and decided to leverage
          my engineering background in a new way to complete a Full-Stack Web
          Development Boot Camp through the University of Washington.

        <p>
          When I am not coding, you can catch me camping, hiking, or cycling.
